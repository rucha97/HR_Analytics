## HR_Analytics_Kaggle

#### This is implementation of Machine Learning graduate course project.  The project relies mainly on the numpy, sklearn, pandas, Pytorch, plotly, pickle and matplotlib.

We have performed our solutions by individuals for each algorithm so we didn't export the conda environment,
please install the libraries by yourself when you try it.


The files should be run in the order:
    - pre-processing.ipynb
    - train_*.pynb
GPU is not required
Training for SVM model take quite long time (around 1 hour)

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle: HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists
